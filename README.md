=======
Serverless, decentralized, rss reader.  
For the people that are lazy enough to avoid using a fullblown software. ;)

Why ?
-----
Google Reader will close, and already all the jackals are around 
to get your personal informations...
What about using your own capacities to achieve the same stuff...
**without server**... **without complex setup**... ?

How ?
-----
I assume you have a decent/recent web browser, so, be aware that 
some functionalities relies on those browsers, like: localstorage, CSS3, etc.

What do I have to do ?
----------------------
You can host the stuff by yourself, but I guess you're not interested 
in such complex operation, so you just have to go on [the official site](kane-thornwyrd.github.com/stapRss).
And the cool thing is that noone else than you will have access to your
datas, because it's your browser that work, not a distant/unknown server !
