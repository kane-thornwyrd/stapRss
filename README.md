=======
Serverless, decentralized, rss reader.
For the people that are lazy enough to avoid using a fullblown software. ;)

Why ?
-----
Google Reader will close, and already all the jackals are around
to get your personal informations...
What about using your own capacities to achieve the same stuff...
**without server**... **without complex setup**... ?

How ?
-----
I assume you have a decent/recent web browser, so, be aware that
some functionalities relies on those browsers, like: localstorage, CSS3, etc.

What do I have to do ?
----------------------
You can host the stuff by yourself, but I guess you're not interested
in such complex operation, so you just have to go on [the official site](http://kane-thornwyrd.github.com/stapRss/).
And the cool thing is that noone else than you will have access to your
datas, because it's your browser that work, not a distant/unknown server !

What's that name ???
--------------------
It's a strange and failed pun about "stapes", not the ones that goes
with horses, but those you have in your ears, well known as the lightest
bones of the entire human body.

That doesn't work !!!!
----------------------
Do you see the small badge "build failing" just on the right of the title ???
(yes this one: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kane-thornwyrd/stapRss.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kane-thornwyrd/stapRss) )
It indicate that the application is crashed because I'm developping/modifying
stuffs inside and broke something.
If it's not "build failing", that's not from my side, in this case you can
search an issue that look like your situation, and if I have some time/motivation
and I can, I'll fix the problem...
But beware:

1. I use it ! So I'm motivated to get it working.
2. If your business/life/whatever depend on it, and so you desperatly need to have it working, you have 3 choices:
  * Whine like a crybaby.
  * Wait patiently.
  * Motivate-me by donating.
